  <h1>You Won The Lottery!</h1>

  <p>
    You go to your favorite bar, Tommy’s, to have a few diet cokes after a stressful day at your job as a dog masseuse. It’s only three P.M., but luckily the windows of the bar are blacked out, making it seem as if it’s much later. You enjoy your diet coke, savoring the flavor.  
    Then, you remember the lottery ticket you found on the ground outside the dog spa. You ask the bartender for a penny and begin scratching.
    <br><br>
    It’s your lucky day! You won <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">$500,000!</span>
    <br><br>
    But your debt is over twenty million due to a failed food truck business from the month prior! You wish there was a way to turn this $500,000 into much more…
    <br><br>
    Seemingly because of kismet, two men begin talking to you.
    <br><br>
    One man, sitting next to you enjoying a full sugar Coke, says he can help you open a restaurant. He seems warm and nice.
    <br><br>
    However, the other man is super creepy. He rises from a dark booth and stays in the shadows as he approaches you. He beckons ominously and whispers in a thick southern accent, “Wanna make a ton of cash by opening a shell company and laundering money?” 
    <br><br>
    You ponder the options… which one do you want?
