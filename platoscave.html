As Sontag talks about in her article, cameras are everywhere. I am rarely without my phone, which has a decent camera. I find myself taking a lot of images each day, some with meaning and some without. The moments that I capture an image, and soon afterwards forget that I took it, speaks to the idea that cameras and images capture transient moments, and increasingly saturating our environment, in this case my phone's photo gallery. When I intentionally take images for the explicit reason of creating art (for myself or others), I usually document something I find interesting. For example, I enjoy structures like buildings. I appreciate the patterns, the designs of the facades, railings, windows, and often fire escapes. I take a photo to capture the state of the building, paying attention to the architecture and design of the building or a part of it. However, that image does not bring the viewer accurately in front of the building depicted. The viewer will not be able to see the full building, hear the sounds of the residents and neighborhood, or smell the scents from the restaurants and flowers nearby. They may see the image and appreciate the beauty of the building, but they will not truly experience or understand the building and its surroundings (which are an element of the building itself). I also intentionally capture memories and moments with my friends and family. While I enjoy looking over old photos of dates with my partner, excursions with my family, or moments with my dog, it does correlate to Sontag’s idea that one associate's life with how a camera captures it. The image of me and my partner smiling at Untermyer Garden doesn’t allude to the argument we had before or the steps we took to address it. It doesn’t reveal that the water fountain was broken, so we had to buy water from a store. The photograph only showcases one moment of a sequence of moments that happened that day. It only gives a brief glimpse, but when one is nostalgic, they romanticize and idealize the experience, condensing it into that brief moment captured by the camera. 
      
While it is difficult to convey a full range of experiences in a single photograph, it could be possible. The image could be multiple images, taken in chronological order of moments in a single event. For the garden example, the final product could be images of; my partner and I arguing, smiling, holding the water bottle in front of the store, and any other relevant moments that would convey the experience accurately. While this does have flaws, it does a substantially better job than a single still image. This example, when put into practice, could feasibly make images more representative of situations, and the world. The superficial engagement would be decreased, and viewers would be able to accurately understand events to a better degree. However, the issue of photographers being voyeuristic remains. While this cannot be avoided, I do not think it is necessary. While there may be influence on the photographer’s part to control the narrative, I would argue that if scenes or subjects had an awareness of their image being captured, they would behave differently. If a thief knew of a security camera, the video would be much different than if the thief did not know. While the owner of the camera may crop the video to make it appear as if the thief was worse than before, which is immoral, the sequence is still something that happened, albeit edited.
