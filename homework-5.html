For this photomontage, I wanted to add in "OTW", as a way to indicate the drivers moving throughout the city. I wanted it to reflect the dominant blue in the image, so I chose a blue gradient fill layer, and added an exterior stroke to make it pop. I added a lowered-opacity white background with the brush tool, to make stand out. For the shape, I distorted a star shape, indicating the ratings the drivers recieve from the customer. After resizing each instance of the star, including one cut in half but still respecting the gradient, I grouped them into a layer group in photoshop. From there, I was able to adjust the opacity slightly, and the "Darken Color" blend mode, to allow for the texture to be shown through the shapes, as well as blend more into the overall collage.

          I also made an alternate for this photomontage, viewable  <a href="alternate-hw5.html">HERE.</a>

For this photomontage, I wanted to hilight the image of the crabs, which seems out of place, much like a healthy convenient option in a food desert. I chose to edit the text "CRABS", smoothing it and distorting the text slightly, to make it also read “CHAOS”. I also added a glow in the background to make it more readable and visible. For the repeating shape, I choose a blob, with contrasting and bright colors. I wanted to add to the confusion that is present in the "junk food" section of the original collage. I did this by once again grouping the instances of the shape, in various sizes, and applying the "Linear Light" blend mode, reducign the opacity, and moving the group to cover parts of the collage.
