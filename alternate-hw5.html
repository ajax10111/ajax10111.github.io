For this alternate, I edited the “Xerox” texture layer, to only apply to the vector, water, and parks on the map. I also removed the texture over the train lines, and over the vector images to blend them more into the map. I liked the result of this one a lot, as everything blends well. To make it non distructive, I copied the original layer as a PNG with transparency after I erased what I didn’t want, closed Photoshop without saving, and then added the edited texture layer back. I copied the settings (Overlay, 55% opacity) and grouped the adjustments, both texture layers, and the vector of OTW and its background together, so I can make either layer visible.
