For this image, I decided to incorporate the rule of thirds, for the foreground of the image. By making the roof of the building confined, and disappearing, from the right of the image, it gives the viewer a focal point which in turn makes them realize the scale and height of which the photo was taken. It also helps to emphasize the skyline, the focus of the image. I increased the brightness and contrast to give the image a slightly more dramatic look, and to define the buildings in the clouds more. I also manipulated the hue slightly to give it a bluish tint. I also used the straighten tool, choosing the vertical line of the box on the side of the building in the foreground, to straighten the image. While there is some slight banding and graininess present in the image because of the compression when it was cropped to a smaller size, I'm very happy with the result, and the banding and graininess could contribute to the clouds.
