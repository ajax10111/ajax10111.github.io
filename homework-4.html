For this collage, I wanted to touch on the food delivery workers that are everywhere in New York, especially Manhattan. They seem to mesh into the city, and you see them on their ebikes wheezing through the streets at all times of the day and night, however they are heavily surveilled by the customer and the app. I chose to make the backdrop, the classic MTA subway map, vibrant and visible, while adding blending layers (Linear Burn and Hard Mix) and increased exposure and brightness to the delivery drivers to make them stand out, while sort of blending into the map. I finished with an overlay I found online to achieve a gritty “xerox” effect, representing the plights of those who work in the streets and avenues of the city.
      <br/>
I created layer masks to isolate the subjects and parts of the original image I wanted to include, and utilized clipping masks, in an effort to be non-destructive and return to the original image if necessary, without the mask or effects. The source of the images varies, but the bikers and map were through news stories via Google Images. The surveillance cameras were from Wikimedia Commons, and the overlay was from a Reddit post in R/Photoshop. Overall, my intended social issue of the plights of those who deliver food in the city, who are heavily surveilled via; GPS, efficiency metrics, by the customer ordering the food, and the relationship they have with this surveillance and the city itself. A personal experience I had was when I was working for UberEats, and a customer called me asking why I was “taking so long” and that I should have taken a different route, and that they “saw me take a longer route.”     </p>

For this collage, I wanted to try to capture a food desert (an area that lacks access to affordable and convenient healthy food). The overall concept of food deserts, and the lack of access to healthy food, can create confusion and discomfort, causing the procurement of good food by people who live in those areas difficult. I tried to capture this in my collage. I used blending modes such as Linear and Hard Light, as well as Overlay, to make the images mesh together in a confusing way. By increasing the exposure and vibrance of the images, as well as using color balance and selective color, I was able to make the image hard to digest and overwhelming. 
          <br/>
I utilized adjustments assigned to each layer, as a clipping mask, to make the edits reversible and editable, as well as layer masks to preserve the initial image. I was able to extract the parts of the original I wanted to use, while leaving the other parts intact. The unhealthy food at the top of the image (Candy, McDonalds, Taco Bell) were edited to make them appear stale and out-of-date, while the lower half of the image (fresh produce, potatoes, crabs, and salmon) are vibrant and in a less confusing layout. The images are all open source from various websites, and the McDonalds image is in the public domain. I did use generative fill for a 10x10px spot with no pixels.
