For this image, I decided to overwhelm the limits of the rule of thirds. I made the door roughly two thirds of the image, and the blank wall the one third of the image, while the window in the door is on the adjacent one third of the image. This helps the viewer solely focus on the door, and then onto the window in the door itself. I also increased the aperture of the camera, allowing everything inside the building to join together, and the window with daylight to be sharply in focus. I adjusted the hue to a lighter blue, making the picture appear cool, while also decreasing the brightness to further pronounce the window, while limiting visibility inside. I also adjusted the curves slightly to allow more of the original color (the yellow step and the differing colors of the wall) to be more visible, while focusing in on the building appearing through the window.    <br/><br/>
