    <p><b>Artist Statement:</b>
      
      I’ve always been drawn to learning about, and capturing things, that others don’t see, or don’t want to see. When I was younger, and I saw things happening or asked about certain things, my parents didn’t explain it to me. They simply said “they’re doing bad things” or “it doesn’t matter.” I started to pay more attention to the things they shunned, and found out what was happening. When I was in middle school, I was always fascinated with how the facades and silhouettes of buildings looked, or patterns I stumbled upon. I took my bike and my phone with a cracked screen, after school to hunt down abandoned buildings. I captured images of broken, rotting walls and shattered windows, and the evidence of people using these structures as illegal real estate. As I grew up, my style adjusted. In 2021, when I started rebuilding my life and ambitions, the passion to document what others don’t see grew. Having experienced the emotions Edward Hopper captures, or identifying myself in some of Heironyous Bosch’s depictions, like the unbridled release of dopamine in The Garden Of Earthly Delights, or seeing scenes i’ve been involved in or viewed on Cops or Vice, the “gritty” documentaries that inspired me to capture raw moments in life, edited only to convey the emotions or isolate the subject. I want to make art, through visual and written media, to help people confront what they don't want to, or to explore something they have no experience with.
