<h1>St. Kitts</h1>

<p>Good choice! St. Kitts has several attractive features to money launderers. Low tax rates, a relaxed government willing to turn a blind eye to inconsistencies in documents, and a program to obtain citizenship through a donation, you’re well set up! 
      <br><br>

  Bob shows you to your new business, which he’s named “Bob’s Phone Cases We Pay Taxes”, in a beautiful forest at the center of the island.
      <br><br>

  However, a local government official who calls himself “Mr. Money” approaches you as you’re spray painting your business name on your building’s cracked walls.
      <br><br>

  “Give me a bribe of $25,000!” He demands. “I’ll help make sure you’re successful and sell lots of phone cases!” 
      <br><br>

  Do you pay up, or tell him to leave you alone?
