    <h2>Dollar Bills/Money</h2>

For this item, I chose hues and tones of green. I wanted to do something representative of money, mainly a take on the dollar bill, which is becoming increasingly obsolete. I started out with a simple rectangle, and added identical blobs, illustrating the treasury and federal seals found on the front of bills, with a darker hue to make them stand out. The lines and dots in the center of the rectangle as a way to represent George Washington’s face. By using different colors, all very different from the lighter background, it leads the eye to focus not on the combination, but towards the sides and edges of the bill, which then leads you to the next repetition in the pattern, and so on. The hexagon with the squiggle represents a bird, speaking to the fleeting nature of money. I decided to offset this hexagon from the edges of the bill, to give it dimension, while also looking like how a quarter looks when change from a purchase is laid down on a counter. The close design, with overlapping hexagons, shows how quickly money flows throughout society, making it an essential and omnipresent force in society.           <br/>

<h2>Ocean Waves</h2>

For this pattern, I used complimentary colors, with hues of blue. My goal was to make a representation of the ocean, with peaceful and calming colors, shapes that represent waves crashing down, and utilizing the darker colors to represent the unpredictable nature of the ocean. I could see this pattern being used for bedspreads or cushion covers that might appear in an themed motel near a beach, or perhaps on a fisherman’s shirt to camouflage them into the sky, so the fish don’t see them. I decided to transform the rectangles into blobs without any real discernable shape, but to make sure that the curves were smooth. This led me to use smaller circles and ovals to illustrate the sea-spray, covering the waves, where the water reabsorbs the drops and sprays. Although the colors used give an overall sense of calm, each element is meant to be confusing when combined, leading to an overall sense of unease. By overlaying the shapes, I was able to introduce the idea of waves washing over each other. I used negative space to allow the viewer to not be as overwhelmed with the pattern, giving the eyes some space to rest and relax, as you would on a beach, peering into the blue ocean.
