**Initially, I wanted to remove all the lines from the shapes. However, I wasn't able to do so, and plan to ask Professor Mendez about that. The second image is the amount of lines/borders I could remove.
      For this project, I wanted to do something with container ships. I'm a big fan of boats, and I like the repetition of the containers. Container/cargo ships usually have a variety of shipping containers aboard, each with their own color and degree of use. I tried to implement shapes that were slightly different in part, and using the available tools to make them appear slanted or angled when necessary. I also combined individual shapes to make the bridge and radar uniform. For the water, I originally wanted to make all the shapes uniform and appear seamless, but as I ran into issues I began to like how the borders looked. They represent the currents, waves, and wake in the water, especially when the ships are underway. This also adds a bit of perspective into the environment. I choose to make the ships orange so they would stand out, as they are the main focus of the environment. I made the water and sky similar-ish colors, to create a smooth blending between the two.
